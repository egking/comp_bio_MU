## Notes

This workshop was modeled from several tutorials available online and in some cases, took material and quotes directly:

[Git for Humans by Alice Bartlett](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)

[Happy Git and Github for the useR by Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/)

[git/github guide by Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

[Version Control with Git from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

A Git and Github cheatsheet is [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Additional Git resources are listed in Karl's guide: [Resources](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/resources.html)

## Ways to use Git

There are a few ways to use Git. We will show you all three today. 

- via the command line 
- via a desktop GitHub client
    - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- via Rstudio (using [RStudio projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects))

## Starting a project (repository)

There are a couple different ways to set up a repository.

1. Starting a repository on GitHub (this is the preferred method)
1. Starting a repository on your machine
    - beginning with an empty project folder
    - beginning with a project folder with stuff in it

> How do you decide what defines a repository?
    
## Starting a repository remotely on GitHub

**Activity**

1. Log in to GitHub.com 
1. Click the "New Repository" button (under the `+` icon in the menu bar)
1. Clone the repository to your local machine

## Benefits of starting a repository on GitHub

- Local copy automatically set to properly interact with guthub
    - Push and pull
- Move local files into empty repository
    - Commit in batch or individually

## Starting a repository locally

- Setting up a new project
    - Start on GitHub
    - Start locally (with & without stuff)

## Ignoring files with `.gitignore`

## Commits

## Syncing: Push and Pull

## Git Clients

## GitKraken

## Command Line

## RStudio Projects

## Problems, warnings, how to recover

Where do problems come from
Burn down

## Distributing code: making things reproducible for others

## Collaborating with others

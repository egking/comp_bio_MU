## Notes

This workshop was modeled from several tutorials available online and in some cases, took material & quotes directly:

[Git for Humans by Alice Bartlett](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)

[Happy Git and Github for the useR by Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/)

[git/github guide by Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

[Version Control with Git from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

A Git and Github cheatsheet is [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Additional Git resources are listed in Karl's guide: [Resources](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/resources.html)

## Ways to use Git

There are a few ways to use Git. We will show you all three today. 

  - via the command line 
  - via a GitHub client (e.g. GitKraken)
  - via Rstudio (using projects)

## Starting a project (i.e. a repository!)

There are a couple different ways to set up a repository. We will go through each method. 

  1. Starting a repository on GitHub (this is the preferred method)

  1. Starting a repository on your machine

    - beginning with an empty project folder

    - beginning with a project folder with stuff in it
    
> How do you decide what defines a repository?

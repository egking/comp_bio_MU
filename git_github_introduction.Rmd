## Notes

This lecture was modeled from several tutorials available online and in some cases, took material & quotes directly:

[Git for Humans by Alice Bartlett](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans)

[Happy Git and Github for the useR by Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/)

[git/github guide by Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

[Version Control with Git from Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

A Git and Github cheatsheet is [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Additional Git resources are listed in Karl's guide: [Resources](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/resources.html)

## What is Git?

1. Git is an application in the same way a web browser or text editor is an application.
1. Git is a version control system (It is not the only one available). 
1. Version control systems are like "track changes" in word. They let you keep track of changes to projects (when you use git with a project, it is called a repository). Basically, they take a snapshot of a project at different stages.

## Why Git?

1. Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects.

    - There are other systems (e.g., numbering files) but they will typically be less consistent in use and implementation and result in file bloat

1. Used properly, you will have an "electronic lab book": a record of every small change

1. Merging collaboratorsâ€™ changes is easy. 

## Why GitHub?

1. Github hosts tons of repositories for projects and software in the life sciences and beyond
1. It lets you see the history of all of these projects in a totally open way
1. It allows for easy, seamless collaboration. You can suggest changes to others, they can suggest things to you. You can collaborate with yourself (home computer, work computer, server).
1. GitHub allows free private repositories for educational use

## Yes, it will hurt to use. It is worth it.

1. Like many aspects of reproducible research, git is something that has a short term cost and a long term benefit. It benefits your future self. 
1. It will take time to learn to use git, to make it part of your routine workflow, and to feel skilled & comfortable with it. Practice is the answer to this.
1. The major benefits are that it makes keeping track of the history of a project possible, and it makes collaborating on a project proceed much more smoothly.

## General Use and Terms

1. **repository** - a set of files for a given project that you will track
1. **commit** - a snapshot of the repository made at a certain time with a message
1. **clone** - making a copy of a repository to another machine
1. **remote** - a place to store the master copy of the repository on the internet (e.g. GitHub) 
1. **branch** - an independent copy of the repository. Often you will try out changes on a developer branch before moving them to the master copy
1. **push** - moving commits to the remote copy
1. **pull** - getting commits from the remote copy
1. **merge** -moving changes from one branch to the master copy

## Use cases

Let's look at some repositories on github to see some examples.

## Assignment 

See [github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and do the following:

1. Get a github account (use your MU email)
1. Download and install git
1. Set up git with your user name and email
1. Set up ssh or a password

Do this before our git workshop!
